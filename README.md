# Genetic Algorithm String Matcher

This project is a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm to match a target string using characters a-z, A-Z, and space.

## Features

- Supports two selection methods: Roulette and Tournament
- Mutation process to generate new generations
- Evolution process output for each generation

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 2.x is installed on your system.
2. Run the program with the command:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
3. Enter the target string (only characters a-z, A-Z, and space).
4. Choose the selection method:
    - 1 for Roulette
    - 2 for Tournament (recommended)
5. The program will display the evolution process until the target string is found.

## Notes

- This program uses Python 2.x
